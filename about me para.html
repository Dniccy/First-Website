        My name is Dominic, and I'm 28 years old. I started my web development journey in February 2025, diving into the world of coding with excitement and curiosity. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been both challenging and rewarding, and every day, I push myself to improve. Whether I'm debugging my first lines of code or building my first website, I love the process of creating and problem-solving. This is just the beginning, but I'm excited to see how far I can go in the ever-evolving world of web development.
